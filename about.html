          <h2>About William</h2>
          <p>
            William ‘Billy’ Talley was born in Hayward, California. Before
            joining the Army, he had several jobs. His favorite job was working
            at Hollywood Video because he loves movies and was able to watch as
            many as he wanted for free, while his least favorite job was working
            at a gas station. If he could choose any line of work, he would
            ideally be working as part of a web design team, focusing on user
            interface and visual design tasks. Alternatively, he would love to
            be a documentary film maker. He has a wife and two sons, and one of
            the funniest memories he has was when he and his two sons dressed up
            and took photos with Santa Claus. In his spare time, he enjoys
            watching true-crime documentaries, especially ones focused on serial
            killers. He is also a huge fan of stand-up comedy and is looking
            forward to being able to go to comedy shows again.
