        <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Billy's father taught him hard work and initiative, and he's carried
          that through into his adult life. He's currently working on completing
          a degree in web development, and has also taken courses in UX design.
          He hopes to incorporate his training into a career working on a web
          design or web development team.
